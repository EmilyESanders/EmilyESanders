### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub!

I am currently studying full-stack developement at Tech Elevator, and I'll be graduating on October 6, 2023. I'm looking forward to getting more projects up here soon, but I appreciate you viewing what I've got so far!

Please note that the Snake Game, Jumping Game and To-Do List application are all works in progress. They are currently functional; however, the Jumping Game and To-Do List application are in very "rough draft" phases. I'm also working on adding more features to the Snake Game (including different difficulty settings and different color themes).

I'm excited to use this space to continually show what I'm working on, and I'd love to connect with and support other developers as well. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
